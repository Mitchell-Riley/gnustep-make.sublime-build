# gnustep-make.sublime-build
GNUstep build system for Sublime Text (for Windows)

Can currently "make" and "clean". "openapp" functionality is sketchy at best because Windows paths are awful.

This will not work ~~if the directory of your GNUmakefile has spaces in it, or~~ if you have GNUstep installed in a weird location.

### Install
```
cd C:\Documents and Settings\Application Data\%USER%\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User && git clone https://github.com/Mitchell-Riley/gnustep-make.sublime-build.git gnustep-make
```
