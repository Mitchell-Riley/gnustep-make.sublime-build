#GNUstep build system for Sublime Text (for Windows)

Can currently "make", "clean", and execute a Windows friendly "openapp".

This will not work if you have GNUstep installed in a weird location.

### Install
Perform this in the Packages directory
```
git clone https://github.com/Mitchell-Riley/gnustep-make.sublime-build.git gnustep-make
```
