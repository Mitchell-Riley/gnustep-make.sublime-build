# gnustep-make.sublime-build
GNUstep build system for Sublime Text (for Windows)

Can currently "make" and "clean". "Openapp" functionality is sketchy at best because Windows paths are awful, but you can use it by uncommenting it.

This will not work if the directory of your GNUmakefile has spaces in it, or if you have GNUstep installed in a weird location.

### Install
Move "gnustep-make.sublime-build" to "C:\Documents and Settings\Application Data\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User".
